Git Workshop Part 4: Python Packaging
=====================================


Purpose
_______

In this documentation we just have some tasks that will help you understand
the features of the
`Kiwi Template for Python Packages <https://git.tu-berlin.de/bvt-htbd/kiwi/cookiecutter-python-package-template>`_.
For a description of the content that enables you to solve the tasks,
please take a look at the
`template's documentation <https://kiwi-python-package-template.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest>`_.

Tasks
________

The idea of the tasks is that you create a python package arround this file:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: number_magic.py

   def addition(arg1, arg2):
       """
       This functions adds the first and the second argument.

       :param arg1: the first summand
       :type arg1:  float
       :param arg2: the second and last summand
       :type arg2:  float
       :return:     the sum of both summands
       :rtype:      float
       """
       return arg1 + arg2
